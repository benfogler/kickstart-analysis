# Kickstarting Challenge

## Overview of Project
Elouise has been working on a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds and determine what/where best to host her event's that will be based by category. She has collated a data set that outlines what her monetary goals are, what is pleged, the country/currency, and other pertinent data to analyze.

### Purpose
The goal of this project is to determine specific trends by month to target specific months that would be successful for theater related catgories.

## Analysis and Challenges
The analysis contained two line graphs that plotted trends by Launch Date and Goals.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
This part of the analysis took into account the months for a full calendar year, and then summarized them by successful, failed, and canceled on a pivot table. This allowed for 3 different lines on our graph to plot the trend between the 3.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The purpose of this analysis was to look at the outcomes based off of what the goal for the theater category. We delineated between a monetary range (i.e. 1000 to 4999) and then summarized by what percentage were successful, failures, or canceled.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
There were no specific challenges arranging and creating the visualization, but one should take into consideration the type of graph/chart they decide to use. A Bar or Column Graph overlayed between the two outcomes may have left some level of disparity or misunderstanding of the true trend.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	1. April through August show's the highest success in comparison to other months (aside from February). These would likely be the best months to host her events.
	2. While almost all months had a higher amount of successes over failures, December cam in with only 3 more successes. December would likely be a month to not host an event.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	1. The lowest monetary goals (Less than 1,000 to 4,999) held the highest percentage of success, except for 35,000 to 44,999. With the failure rate being respective in these areas these would be the monetary goals to target to gain funding.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
	1. This dataset is only focusing on the difference in success vs. failure by launch date, or by goals. It does not take into consideration the number of backers or the subcategories.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
	1. I would take into consideration the subcategory we are targeting, as well as the number of backers and average donation. We could possibly overlay this with our current graphs to see if there is any correlation to the trends and possibly target those areas specifically.
